        <br><br>
        
        National Housing Development Organisation (NHDO) has been striving to make ‘Housing for All’ a reality. One of the sections of the society which finds it very difficult to own a house in the career span is the salaried sector employees, especially at the lower rung. Towards improving access to housing for this section of the society, NHDO is committed to end the past trails and discover holistic by which all the sections of the society may be benefited.  National Housing Development Organisation (NHDO) has been established as an SPV to promote, control and co-ordinate the development of houses at selected places, across India, on no profit-no loss basis as a welfare measure. NHDO is a registered body & operates from its headquarter at New Delhi. The organisation maintains skeleton project teams at construction sites which look after day to day operations of construction and development.
        <br><br>
        <b style="font-size:20px">The organisation has the mandate to:</b>
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
         
        <b style="font-size:20px">Constitutional Set-up:</b>
        <br><br>
        There are four levels of control in the organisation:<br><br>
        - Board of Trustees<br>
        - Governing Council<br>
        - Executive Committee<br>
        - Chief Executive Officer<br>
        <br><br>
        The Board of Trustees is a constitutional authority which lays down general policy guidelines and makes or amends Rules and Regulations of the organisation. Governing Council manages and administers the affairs of NHDO, approves requirements of staff and lays down policy for investment. Executive Committee looks after the day to day affairs of the organisation. Some of the powers of these bodies have been delegated to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who conducts the business and executes all contracts on behalf of the organisation.<br><br>
        
         
        
        <b style="font-size:20px">General Philosophy of the Organisation:</b>
        <br><br>
        The Organisation at the Head Office of the NHDO functions on the following philosophy:<br><br>
        - All the works, be it civil construction, electrical, mechanical, developmental or planning, are merely contracted out to outside parties due to our in house pool of professionals.<br>
        - Not very often Firms of Architects are engaged for providing professional services.<br>
        - Central procurement of materials for projects is confined to cement and steel only.<br>
        - Field Committee/Project Teams are set up for each project, to supervise the work. These teams are responsible to the Chief Executive Officer of the NHDO.<br>
        - Other professionals (if not available), like legal advisor, structural consultants, soil consultants etc. are engaged on part time basis or piece meal basis, as the situation demands.<br>
        - A reputed firm of Auditors is appointed to undertake concurrent audit of accounts of the organisation.
        <br><br>
         
        
        <b style="font-size:20px">Organisational Structure:</b>
        <br><br>
        The range of activities covered by the NHDO are multidisciplinary, but the organisation operates under one roof. It is, therefore, prudent to have professional departments each looking after its own field and easily interacting with others. Professional grouping also makes the organisation more compact, effective and responsive. The organisation comprises three directorates, viz., Technical, Administration & Marketing and Finance, all supported by an IT cell.<br><br>
        
        <b style="font-size:20px">Operations:</b>
        <br><br>
        The activities of the organisation encompass the following:
        <br><br>
         
        <b style="font-size:20px">Acquisition of Land</b>
        <br><br>
        The basis on which land is procured in a particular station and the quantum thereof is dependent upon concentration of the members of NHDO or the demand pattern for that particular station. In order to make an objective assessment, specific demand surveys are conducted. Such demand surveys are also helpful in determining the ratio of various types of dwelling units (DUs) to be built in a project. Following percentage density of DUs  adopted in all the initial projects:

        <br><br>

        <table align="center" style="width: 759px; height: 306px;" border="2" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><thead><tr><th scope="col">%Type of DU<br></th><th scope="col">Accommodation<br></th><th scope="col">Approx. Super Area (Sq. Ft.)<br></th><th scope="col">Percentage Density of DUs<br></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A<br></td><td>1 Bedroom unit<br></td><td>550<br></td><td>15%<br></td></tr><tr><td>B<br></td><td>2 Bedroom unit<br></td><td>850<br></td><td>60%<br></td></tr><tr><td>C<br></td><td>3 Bedroom unit<br></td><td>1100<br></td><td>20%<br></td></tr><tr><td>D<br></td><td>3 Bedroom&nbsp;&amp; Study unit<br></td><td>1350<br></td><td>5%<br></td></tr></tbody></table>

        <br><br>
        Planning of projects is taken up only after membership campaign is over followed by firm allotment of the land has been obtained and the housing scheme is announced, subsequently. Procurement of land is made from the State Land Allotting Agencies or private agencies as considered appropriate, on case to case basis.
        <br><br>

        <b style="font-size:20px">Planning of the Projects:</b>
        <br><br>
        The projects are planned and executed by adopting either of the following two methods:
        <br><br>
        - <b>Conventional Method:</b> Once the station is identified for taking up a project, the organisation procures land from local land allotting authorities. In this case, once the allotment of land is made, the organisation’s appointed Architect Consultant who technically supervise the project during execution based upon the criterion and procedure, as approved by the Executive Committee, as well as the contractor(s), for execution of the project.
        <br><br>
        
        - <b>Turnkey Contract Method:</b> When land is not made available by the local land allotting authority inspite of clear demand in the station, this is the only method available to meet the aspirations of the prospective beneficiaries. This method has also got the merit of reducing the initial investment on the project towards procurement of land and keeping the same for a gestation period for planning and finalising the contracts for execution of works. In this method, the agency can be finalised prior to any investment from the organisation and funds towards procurement of land are required only when the turnkey contractor registers the same in the name of the organisation. In the intervening period, the scheme can be announced and the cost of land can be called from prospective beneficiaries, thereby reducing the cost of interest on investment towards procurement of land. Further, turnkey contracts enable the organisation to deal with one agency only which, in effect, reduces the administrative hurdles etc. towards execution of the contracts as well as release of payments. Further, turnkey contracts work out to be economical as the cost of development of land is substantially lower than that incurred by State Land Allotting Agencies.
        
        <br><br> 
        
        <b style="font-size:20px">Housing Scheme:</b>
        <br><br>
        A housing project, when planned and duly costed for different type of dwelling units, is offered as a `Housing Scheme’.
        <br><br>
        1. <b>Announcement:</b> The housing scheme so formulated is announced through newspapers, inviting applications from the interested and eligibles. For better dissemination of information regarding the housing schemes, other methods of communication used are NHDO’s newsletter, etc.<br>
        2. <b>Registration and Allotment:</b> Applications are invited in pre-defined format (which is made available at a nominal cost on demand alongwith a brochure containing terms and conditions, known as ‘NHDO Rules’). A computerised draw, from amongst the eligible applicants, is held in case the number of applications received exceeds the number of dwelling units being offered. A small waiting list is also created, and further allotments are made based on withdrawals / cancellations. Allotment letters, issued to the successful applicants, include terms and conditions of allotment and tentative payment schedule. Instalments are called based on this payment schedule and progress of the project on ground.
        <br><br>

        <b style="font-size:20px">Execution of the Projects:</b>
        <br><br>
        A housing project, when planned and duly costed for different type of dwelling units, is offered as a `Housing Scheme’.<br>
        1. <b>Construction Agency:</b> If the project is planned a non-conventional one, then a construction agency is selected at this stage for execution of the project in accordance with the detailed and elaborate procedure, as approved by the Executive Committee. However, in case of turnkey contract method, the construction agency already exists and the same commences construction immediately.<br>
        2. <b>Management and Control of Projects:</b> To ensure adherence to the planning schedule, maintenance of quality and economy in construction, NHDO projects are supervised, managed and controlled under four tier arrangements as under :<br>
        - An Architect Consultant appointed to provide for Project Management Services.<br>
        - A project team headed by a Project Manager, appointed specifically by NHDO for the particular project.<br>
        - Technical inspections and monitoring of the progress by officers of the Technical Directorate from the Head Office including regular visits and inspections by the CEO.<br>
        - Appointment of a reputed technical institution to provide quality assurance consultancy to the project viz. IITs etc.
        <br><br>
        <b style="font-size:20px">Closure :</b>
        <br><br>
        On receipt of the final payment from the beneficiaries, which includes the escalation and interest components, if any, the Apartment Owners Association charges etc., possession of the dwelling units is handed over to the beneficiaries. A NHDO project is expected to be handed over completely within five months of the date of issue of the final call-up letters. An effort is made to adhere to this schedule, including complying with statutory requirements like registration of the respective sale/lease deed etc. On completion of this activity, a project/scheme of the NHDO is considered as closed.
        <br><br>
        <b style="font-size:20px">Maintenance :</b>
        <br><br>
        An Apartment Owners’ Association is formed from amongst the beneficiaries towards the completion of construction activities and handed over the charge of the residential complex for managing its various affairs. In order to provide this association with an initial fund, an element of 1.5% of the cost of dwelling unit, which is built into the total cost of the dwelling unit, is reserved in the name of ‘Apartment Owners’ Association’ charges and handed over to the association.
